## My Story

After 33 years at Pixar Animation Studios, I have unexpectedly found
myself searching for my next challenge.  I've done a number of different
jobs at Pixar, including working for seven different departments
with credits on over twenty feature films, with roles that required
leadership, writing and maintaining large code bases, original research
which lead to four different patents and technical problem solving at
every level.  

I'm currently taking some time before diving back in,
but if you are interested in hearing from me, feel free to 
[send me an email](mailto:mvandewettering@gmail.com) and tell me of 
any opportunities that you think may be of mutual interest.

- Leadership across multiple disciplines, including technical lighting, 
stereoscopic 3D, software development and workflow development
- Collaboration with people in both artistic and technical disciplines
- Programming, with skills in C++ and Python and familiarity with many other languages

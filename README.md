After 33 years at Pixar Animation Studios, I have unexpectedly found myself searching for my next challenge.  I've done a number of different jobs at Pixar, including working for seven different departments with credits on over twenty feature films, with roles that required leadership, writing and maintaining large code bases, original research which lead to four different patents and technical problem solving at every level.  I'm currently taking some time before diving back in, but if you are interested in hearing from me, feel free to [email me]{mailto:mark@mvandewettering.com}.
